# Competition_Face_Count  
Ongoing Notebook for visual computing exploration via Keras Neural Network  
The Goal is to estimate number of Faces in a given picture.
The Subgoal is to locate faces and draw a bounding box around them.
My personal goal is to transfer-train an existing visual NN (Resnet50) and make use of con.neural networks.
